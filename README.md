# Spatial-and-Temporal-Distribution-Characteristics-and-Optimization-of-Didi-Taxi-Orders

This project is a data-analysis project about open dataset of didi-company.
Organized the order data of Didi in Chengdu, analyzed the data by time series analysis, dynamic analysis, grouping analysis and principles of  kernel density estimation;
Concluded time and space characteristics of the Didi Taxi orders, proposed the corresponding optimization measures, and  analyzed the expected effect by the analytic hierarchy process;
Established model to calculate relevant indexes and located the most effective measures, output final research report.
